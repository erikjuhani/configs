# Overview
These are my personal _dotfiles_. Mainly for `go` and `typescript` development environments.
Best used with neovim and fish shell. (which are both installed with scripts included)

This is only intended for darwin operating system (Mac),
because of the heavy use of homebrew package manager.

## Setup
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:erikjuhani/dotfiles ~

# Run the environment scripts with make
make init
```
