# My Personal Nvim / Vim Configuration
Works best with Mac and Xubuntu (xcfe4) as those are the systems I use.

This has been setup to be used mainly with languages `typescript` and `go`.

## Setup
```sh
# Clone this repository
git clone git@github.com:erikjuhani/dotfiles ~

# Startup nvim
nvim

# Install Plugins
:PlugInstall

# Quit and restart nvim
:q!
```
